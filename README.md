# Candle-Flame-Detector-with-OpenCV-and-TensorFlow

## :book: Description

### :dart: Objective 

This project goal was developing a algorithm that detect a candle flame on a house's simulation, to be used on a "fireman robot". For implementation of this project was made using Python, OpenCV and Keras-TensorFlow.

### :fire_engine: Fire-fighting robot contest 

On IPG(Institute Polytechnic of Guarda) in Portugal annually happens a contest called Fire-fighting robot that consisting of an autonomous robot find a candle flame on a house's simulation and blowing it out.

### :file_folder: Files

#### :page_facing_up: Training_CFD_model.py

This [file](https://github.com/herickyves/Candle-Flame-Detector-with-OpenCV-and-TensorFlow/blob/master/Training_CFD_model.py) training and creates the [model](https://github.com/herickyves/Candle-Flame-Detector-with-OpenCV-and-TensorFlow/blob/master/classificador_de_chama.h5) generated by the neural network.  

The architecture used was the feedfoward neural network.

#### :page_facing_up: Classificador.py

This [file](https://github.com/herickyves/Candle-Flame-Detector-with-OpenCV-and-TensorFlow/blob/master/Classificador.py) are a library to do the setup of the model in the main file. 

#### :page_facing_up: Candle_flame_detector.py

This [file](https://github.com/herickyves/Candle-Flame-Detector-with-OpenCV-and-TensorFlow/blob/master/Candle_flame_detector.py) is the main file and have two objectives: 
- Create the samples.
- Detect the flame.

#### :file_folder: Dataset
