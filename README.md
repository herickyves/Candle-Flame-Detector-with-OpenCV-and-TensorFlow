# Candle-Flame-Detector-with-OpenCV-and-TensorFlow

## Description

### Objective 

his project goal was developing a algorithm that detect a candle flame on a house's simulation, to be used on a "fireman robot". For implementation of this project was made using Python, OpenCV and Keras-TensorFlow.

### Fire-fighting robot contest 

On IPG(Institute Polytechnic of Guarda) in Portugal annually happens a contest called Fire-fighting robot that consisting of an autonomous robot find a candle flame on a house's simulation and blowing it out.
